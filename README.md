# siclp

Solutions to "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (SICP) in Common Lisp

## Usage

You can run a repl in each file and execute the exercise's expressions

## Reason for this project

- I was exposed to clojure through work and enjoyed the REPL driven development and expression of the language
- Became interested in Common Lisp (mostly for its history and the passion many people still have for it)
- I got a copy of SICP (also from work) and wanted to go through some of the exercises
- Instead of using Scheme as taught in the book, I wanted to use Common Lisp

## Disclaimer

This is a scratch repo.  It is unlikely I will complete (even close to) every exercise of every chapter.  I plan on coming back
to this as I have time and interest in continuing.
